Circular chromatic index of snarks with cyclic connectivity at least 4 (and girth at least 4) up to 30 vertices. The order of indices in `output.cchi` corresponds to the lists of snarks available on House of Graphs.

Snarks with index > 10/3 (so far 17 of them) is given in specific files; a single file for a given index and a given order.
